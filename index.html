									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>
											As a candidate, I will be proud to run on the record of our government under Prime Minister Harper. Some of the policies I'm particularly proud of include policies that make the lives of families better, that build and maintain our infrastructure, and economic policies that continue to keep taxes low while leading us back to surplus. I support policies that cut the GST from 7 to 5%; created Tax-Free Savings Accounts, which now benefit nearly 11 million Canadians; and reduced the lowest personal income tax rate and increased the basic personal amount. I was a member of the policy committee which proposed this last policy, built support for it from ridings across Canada, and brought the proposal to the floor of a policy convention. It was thrilling to see the delegates' voting cards go up in a yes vote for this policy, and even better when our government implemented the policy.

									</ul>												 
									<div class="row" style="height:2px; background: rgba(13,83,172,0.5);"></div></br>
									<ul>
										<li>
										<p>
										I support increased benefits for families-a number of these will take effect as of January 1, 2015 and I look forward to knocking on doors to discuss these benefits. Parents will receive an enhanced Universal Child Care benefit of $160 per month for each child under the age of six -and a new benefit of up to $720 a year for children aged six through 17.  The Family Tax Cut is a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 for couples with children under the age of 18, effective for the 2014 tax year.

									</ul>											 
									<div class="row" style="height:2px; background: rgba(13,83,172,0.5);"></div></br>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>
											As the mother of a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I've seen the programs that work for our vets as well as those that may need some fine tuning. I'd like to champion our government's compassionate care for the vets who have come back wounded in body or spirit.

									<div class="row" style="height:2px; background: rgba(13,83,172,0.5);"></div></br>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>
											I'm pleased to have been able to attend a number of our government's local pre-budget consultations which listened to Canadians and heard their views on how Canada can create jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. I've heard that we need to reduce red tape and make government more nimble for business, big and small, and I've seen our government respond to these challenges. I've also heard that we need policies to keep taxes low, and heard plaudits about the expected return to surplus after the government invested in infrastructure during difficult economic times worldwide.  The focus is on creating jobs and growth, and as someone who's operated a small business, I will keep this a clear focus in our new riding of Kitchener South-Hespeler.

									With my sons grown and on their own, and the support of a loving spouse, the time is certainly right for me to seek the nomination in our riding. I believe that my years of business, volunteer and government experience give me the background necessary to become a Member of Parliament. I've helped create and grow a small business with a strong emphasis on customer satisfaction. I've made connections with the Members of Parliament in the Southwestern Ontario caucus and with many cabinet Ministers over my years of involvement with both the Conservative Party and the government. My knowledge of campaigning is from the ground up. I've worked the phones, knocked on doors, served as election day chair, coloured in poll maps-no job was too big or too small. This background will allow me to hit the ground running as a candidate and then-if the voters decide-as your Member of Parliament.

							The Constitution of Canada requires that the number of seats in the House of Commons be recalculated and the boundaries of federal electoral districts be reviewed after each 10-year census to reflect changes and movements in Canada's population. This process is known as the redistribution of federal electoral districts. The recalculating process after the 2011 census led to one new riding being created in our area for the 2015 election, called Kitchener South-Hespeler.
			The new riding's boundaries as described by Elections Canada:
			(a) the part of the City of Cambridge lying northerly of Highway No. 401 (Hespeler)
			(b) the part of the City of Kitchener lying easterly and southerly of a line described as follows: commencing at the intersection of the southerly limit of said city with Fischer-Hallman Road; thence generally northerly along said road to Conestoga Parkway; thence generally northeasterly along said parkway to Highway No. 8; thence southeasterly along said highway to Fairway Road South; thence generally northeasterly along said road, Fairway Road North and Woolner Drive to Zeller Drive; thence southeasterly along Kossuth Road and its southeasterly production to the easterly limit of said city (Grand River).
