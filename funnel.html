Go, go, go, go, go, go                                                 </br>

We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday                            </br>
And you know we don't give a ****, it's not your birthday              </br>
                                                                       </br>
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub                         </br>
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz                  </br>
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love                          </br>
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed                       </br>

So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed                       </br>

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs                     </br>
When I roll 20 deep, it's always drama in da club                      </br>
N***** I heard I roll with Dre, everybody show me love                 </br>
When you sell like Eminem you get plenty of groupie love               </br>
                                                                       </br>
But homie ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up                       </br>
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that ****** roll that **** up                 </br>
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp          </br>
Been hit wit a few ****** but I don't walk with a limp                 </br>
                                                                       </br>
In the hood then the ladies saying, "50, you hot"                      </br>
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac               </br>
But holla in New York they surely will tell ya I'm loco                </br>
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold                    </br>
                                                                       </br>
I'm feelin' focused, man, my money on my mind                          </br>
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind                   </br>
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow              </br>
Her girlfriend willin' to get bi and they ready to go                  </br>
                                                                       </br>

My flow, my show brought me the dough                                  </br>
That bought me all my fancy things                                     </br>
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels                                  </br>
Look homey, I done came up and I ain't change                          </br>
                                                                       </br>
And you should love it, way more then you hate it                      </br>
Oh you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it                    </br>
I'm that cat by the bar, toasting to the good life                     </br>
Moved out the hood, now trying to pull me back, right?                 </br>
                                                                       </br>
When my junk get to pumpin' in da club it's on                         </br>
I wink my eye at ya chick, if she smiles she gone                      </br>
If the roof on fire, man, just let it burn                             </br>
If you're talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned                </br>
                                                                       </br>
I'm a tell you what Banks told me                                      </br>
'Cause go 'head, switch the style up                                   </br>
And if they hate then let 'em hate                                     </br>
Then watch the money pile up                                           </br>
                                                                       </br>
Or we can go upside their head with a bottle of bub                    </br>
Come on, they know where we be                                         </br>
                                                                       </br>
